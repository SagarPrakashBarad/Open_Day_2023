        <h1>2D Equations of Motion and Acceleration Due to Gravity</h1>
		<section>
	<p>On this page, we will explore the concept of 2D equations of motion and acceleration due to gravity. We will see how these concepts are applied in real-world scenarios, such as the trajectory of a basketball.</p>
    <p>In two-dimensional motion, an object moves along both the x and y-axis simultaneously. The equations of motion can be used to determine the position, velocity, and acceleration of an object in 2D space.</p>
	<p>The equations of motion in the x and y direction are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>$$x = x_0 + v_{0x}t + 1/2 a_x t^2$$</li>
		<li>$$v_x = v_{0x} + a_xt$$</li>
		<li>$$y = y_0 + v_{0y}t + 1/2a_yt^2$$</li>
		<li>$$v_y = v_{0y} + a_yt$$</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Where x and y are the final position of the object, x0 and y0 are the initial position of the object, v0x and v0y are the initial velocities of the object in the x and y direction respectively, vx and vy are the final velocities of the object in the x and y direction respectively, ax and ay are the acceleration of the object in the x and y direction respectively, and t is the time elapsed.</p>
	<p>The acceleration due to gravity is the force that causes objects to fall towards the ground. On Earth, the acceleration due to gravity is approximately 9.81 m/s^2. In the y-direction, the acceleration due to gravity is always acting downwards, which means $$ a_y = -9.81 m/s^2$$.</p>

			<h2>Basketball Game</h2>
	<p>Now, let's apply the concept of 2D equations of motion and acceleration due to gravity in a fun way. Try to score as many points as possible by throwing the basketball into the hoop. The trajectory of the basketball is determined by the initial velocity and the angle at which it is thrown, taking into account the acceleration due to gravity.</p>
