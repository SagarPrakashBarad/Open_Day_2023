      <h2>Discover EM Fields with Functions</h2>
      <p>Electric and magnetic fields are all around us, but they can be tricky to understand. That's why we've created a fun and interactive module that will help you visualize and experiment with EM fields in a whole new way. Whether you're interested in charged particles or the visual aspects of EM fields, we've got something for you.</p>
